# The RPG Kitchen Collective

(working title)

## Mission Statement

The Collective's mission is to help members of all levels of experience contribute to and improve the table-top industry, to empower members to pursue their specialties on equal footing, and to provide a platform for collective creation.

## Regular Meetings

Meetings run on a regular basis, on the Last Monday of each month, at 5pm EDT/10pm BST. Occasionally extra meetings will be coordinated on an ad-hoc basis. Join the discord above to find out more.

### Next meeting (in your local time):

<script>
var d = new Date(Date.UTC(2021,8,27,21,0,0)); // don't forget, month is 0-based, day is not (yay javascript)
document.getElementById("next-meeting-in-your-local-time").appendChild(document.createTextNode(" " + d.toLocaleString()));
</script>
